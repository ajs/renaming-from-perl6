## projects

Projects (both on and off of github, but on is easier) that have Perl 6 naming.

### API

We can begin with this query:

    https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=perl6

### Boilerplate

From the initial outline:

* Can we enumerate exactly what falls into the item (for `.perl`, this is easy, for editor plugins, maybe not so much...)
* Do we need to change it? (Will it change organically if we don't?)
* If we change it, how will `<new-name>` be integrated? Can we know without knowing what the new name will be? Are there features of a new name that would make this easier/harder/impossible?
* If we change it, will (must?) the old naming remain for compatibility? For how long?
* Do third parties need to get involved? If so, whom?
* Are there administrative concerns? (e.g. making sure mods for a new subreddit are the same)
* Are there costs? Who will pay?  done
