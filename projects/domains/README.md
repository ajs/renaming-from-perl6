## domains

This touches broadly on many high-level topics:

### SEO concerns: "how do you search for the new name?"

* www.google.com/search?q=perl6 - How do we ensure that searches for our new name are equally useful?

### Sites

Major Perl 6 sites that use Perl 6 in their names:

* p6weekly.wordpress.com
* perl6.org (note that perl6 dot com appears to be a hijacked and now malicious site)
* perl6advent.wordpress.com

### Boilerplate

From the initial outline:

* Can we enumerate exactly what falls into the item (for `.perl`, this is easy, for editor plugins, maybe not so much...)
* Do we need to change it? (Will it change organically if we don't?)
* If we change it, how will `<new-name>` be integrated? Can we know without knowing what the new name will be? Are there features of a new name that would make this easier/harder/impossible?
* If we change it, will (must?) the old naming remain for compatibility? For how long?
* Do third parties need to get involved? If so, whom?
* Are there administrative concerns? (e.g. making sure mods for a new subreddit are the same)
* Are there costs? Who will pay?  done
