## perl5

References to the "Perl 6" name in the Perl 5 language and related support/modules/etc.

Note that this does not include the [CPAN hosting for Perl 6 ecosystem modules](../ecosystem)
but it does include CPAN modules for Perl 5 that reference Perl 6.

May be a useful starting point.

It's almost certainly the case that most of this does not *need* to change and will probably
be updated be individual maintainers in the fullness of time... But figuring that out is the
point of this project...

### Boilerplate

From the initial outline:

* Can we enumerate exactly what falls into the item (for `.perl`, this is easy, for editor plugins, maybe not so much...)
* Do we need to change it? (Will it change organically if we don't?)
* If we change it, how will `<new-name>` be integrated? Can we know without knowing what the new name will be? Are there features of a new name that would make this easier/harder/impossible?
* If we change it, will (must?) the old naming remain for compatibility? For how long?
* Do third parties need to get involved? If so, whom?
* Are there administrative concerns? (e.g. making sure mods for a new subreddit are the same)
* Are there costs? Who will pay?  done
