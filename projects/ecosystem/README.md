## ecosystem

### Concerns

* Does META6.json need to change its name?
* Do we need to change the CPAN directory entry for Perl 6 modules (currently `Perl6`)?
* Lots of cocerns that touch on [domain names](../domains) such as where https://modules.perl6.org/ lives.

### Resources

* https://modules.perl6.org/
* https://github.com/perl6/ecosystem
* https://ecosystem-api.p6c.org/projects.json
* https://modules.perl6.org/search/?q=from%3Acpan

### Boilerplate

From the initial outline:

* Can we enumerate exactly what falls into the item (for `.perl`, this is easy, for editor plugins, maybe not so much...)
* Do we need to change it? (Will it change organically if we don't?)
* If we change it, how will `<new-name>` be integrated? Can we know without knowing what the new name will be? Are there features of a new name that would make this easier/harder/impossible?
* If we change it, will (must?) the old naming remain for compatibility? For how long?
* Do third parties need to get involved? If so, whom?
* Are there administrative concerns? (e.g. making sure mods for a new subreddit are the same)
* Are there costs? Who will pay?  done
